## Problem Statement

Domain: Hospitality     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Function: Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
## Task
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
## Step Followed in this Project
1. Performed ETL process (Extract Transform and Load)
2. Data Cleaning in power query.
3. Created measures and new columns for needs using DAX, and used them for creating visuals. ( 80% of the measures were created on my own through guidance provided on the metrics list )
4. Data Validation
5. Data Modelling and Visualization.
## Note
1. A good number of the above tasks was completed through brainstorming and not merely copying what the tutor was doing. I ran into some problems and figured them out by way of researching.
2. The provided **input-file** consists of the raw file for the project ( the various tables, the mock-up dashboard, metrics list ), provided by *codebasics*.
